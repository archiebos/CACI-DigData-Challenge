I gained work experience with CACI by completing an online challenge hosted by DigData.

The project aim was to identify 250 people out of 10,000 to invite to an exclusive launch party of a new product. The method consisted of making a logistic regression model to calculate the probability of the individual being interested based on similar characteristics in the test data set. The biggest challenge that I faced was during the exploratory analysis when trying to calculate which variables would be the most appropriate to include without breaching the assumption of a regression model with no multicollinearity.

Skills Developed:

- Exploratory Analysis 
- Conducting Rigorous Modelling procedure
- Knowledge of choosing an appropriate model and conducting tests to prove the optimal choice
